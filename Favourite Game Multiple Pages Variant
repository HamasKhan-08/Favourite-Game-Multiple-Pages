    <p class="index"><b><em> IGN: </em> "With a strong cast of characters used to varying effect throughout to tell a tale that puts just about enough of a spin on the stories it's paying homage to, Call of Duty: Vanguardâ€™s single-player campaign is an impressively cinematic depiction of World War II. That said, aside from a few standout moments sprinkled over its fleeting five hours, for the most part it plays it a little too safe in regards to mission variety to feel like a standout in the series. It may look and sound spectacular, but it couldâ€™ve used more stylish sections like Petrovaâ€™s to distinguish its gameplay from the many battles weâ€™ve fought before." </b></p>

    <p class="index"><b> <em> Gamespot: </em> "Vanguard also features some new modes and adjustments that enhance the usual multiplayer fare. The competitive menu includes a new option that lets you tune the kind of matches you want to play, leaning into either larger team battles on bigger maps or smaller, more intense firefights that get you into the action quicker. The Patrol mode is a highlight, adding mobility to the control points usually seen in Hardpoint matches, forcing you to constantly chase them around the map, which further adds to the dynamic feel of battles and also incentivizes out-of-the-box thinking to catch opponents unaware." </b></p>
